Overview
The Simon Says game is a classic memory game where players must repeat a sequence of colors (or sounds) in the correct order. 
Each round, the game adds one more color to the sequence, and the player must replicate the entire sequence from the beginning. 
The game continues until the player makes a mistake.

How to Play
1. Start the Game: The game begins by showing (or playing) a sequence of colors. Initially, we press any key and game start.
2. Memorize the Sequence: Pay attention to the sequence of colors shown.
3. Repeat the Sequence: Click the buttons (or use the controls) to repeat the sequence in the exact order.
4. Next Round: If you successfully repeat the sequence, a new color is added to the end of the sequence, and you must repeat the longer sequence.
5. Game Over: The game ends when you make a mistake in the sequence.
